                <h2>Kaeden Wodke</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my website! This is a collection of all the information
                   you might need to know about me! I currently live in Bend, Oregon 
                   and have for 16 years now. In my free time I enjoy playing videogames,
                   having a drink with some friends and playing sports such as basketball
                   and soccer. I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp program through
                   The University of Oregon and am on track to graduate in October with a 
                   Full Stack Engineer Certificate. This certificate demonstrates proficiency 
                   in HTML, css, Javascript, SQL, Node, React and some other languages as well.
                   Apart from my techical ability I am a team player who wants to see everyone
                   succeed and I never shy away from helping people if they need it. I also believe
                   that life would be boring without laughter so I try to mix in my fair share of 
                   humor into the workplace when appropriate. My goal is to grow as a coder and a 
                   person while building on my problem-solving skills through code.

                <h1 class="headings">Website Design</h1>
                <p> If you need a website that looks clean and functions
                    on any screen size then look no further. My best attribute
                    is being able to build websites quickly and efficiently as 
                    this is the skill I've practiced the most and am by far the 
                    most confident in.

                <h1 class="headings">Javascript</h1>
                <p> Being one of the hardest for newcomers to learn
                    it took me some time to grasp Javascript however 
                    now I feel pretty comfortable on it and. Even though 
                    I have much to learn, I feel that what I know could
                    definitely help me out in a work environment.

                <h1 class="headings">Github</h1>
                <p> For our program we primarily use Github to store 
                    and share our work with classmates and instructors. 
                    I have been conditioned to commit often and to be 
                    very descriptive in case there would ever be a need 
                    to revert to a previous commit. I am also very familiar
                    with the branch functionality of Github and how it is 
                    essential to keeping a live project running while still
                    working on it behind the scenes.
