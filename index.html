                <p>Welcome to my website! This is a collection of all the information
                   you might need to know about me! I currently live in Bend, Oregon 
                   and have for 16 years now. In my free time I enjoy playing videogames,
                   having a drink with some friends and playing sports such as basketball
                   and soccer. I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp program through
                   The University of Oregon and am on track to graduate in October with a 
                   Full Stack Engineer Certificate. This certificate demonstrates proficiency 
                   in HTML, css, Javascript, SQL, Node, React and some other languages as well.
                   Apart from my techical ability I am a team player who wants to see everyone
                   succeed and I never shy away from helping people if they need it. I also believe
                   that life would be boring without laughter so I try to mix in my fair share of 
                   humor into the workplace when appropriate. My goal is to grow as a coder and a 
                   person while building on my problem-solving skills through code.
